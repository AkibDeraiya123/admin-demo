This is a simple project setup using React with Vite. Vite provides a fast build process and development server for modern web projects.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository


### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Running the project

#### Development

To start the development server, use the following commands based on your environment:

- **Local Environment:**

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Staging Environment:**

  ```bash

This will start the Vite development server for the specified environment.

### 4. Building the project

To build the project for different environments, use the following commands:
